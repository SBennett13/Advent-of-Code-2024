# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

My solutions to the Advent of Code in 2024. First solving in Python for the algorithmic exercise, then to
reimplement to aide in learning golang.

*NOTE:* Many of the Python solutions are "quick and hacky". I'm trying to teach my self to problem solve quickly without
spending egregious amounts of time overthinking problems that I may not ever even run into. There are certainly fast (in
computer world) ways to solve and there are definitely more memory efficient approaches.
